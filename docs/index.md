# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course provides a deep dive into the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, focusing on creating intelligent humanoid robots that can interact with the real world.

### Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:

#### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1/introduction-to-ros2)
- **Focus**: Middleware for robot control
- **Topics**: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- **Integration**: Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- **Modeling**: Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

#### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2/digital-twin-simulation)
- **Focus**: Physics simulation and environment building
- **Topics**: Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- **Rendering**: High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- **Sensors**: Simulating LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

#### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/module-3/ai-robot-brain)
- **Focus**: Advanced perception and training
- **Topics**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- **Perception**: Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation
- **Navigation**: Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

#### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/module-4/vision-language-action)
- **Focus**: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics
- **Topics**: Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- **Planning**: Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
- **Capstone**: The Autonomous Humanoid project

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2 as the middleware
- Create realistic simulations using Gazebo and Unity for testing and training
- Leverage NVIDIA Isaac platform for advanced perception and navigation
- Integrate large language models with robotic systems for natural interaction
- Build end-to-end autonomous humanoid systems that respond to voice commands

### Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic programming experience in Python and/or C++
- Understanding of fundamental AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

### Getting Started

Navigate to [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1/introduction-to-ros2) to begin your journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

### Capstone Project

The course culminates in a capstone project where students will build an autonomous humanoid robot that can:
1. Receive voice commands using OpenAI Whisper
2. Plan a path using LLM-based cognitive planning
3. Navigate obstacles using advanced perception systems
4. Identify and manipulate objects using computer vision
5. Execute complex tasks in real-world environments
